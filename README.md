<h3>Working:</h3>
In order to use all of the features, the user mandatorily needs to first signup and then signin. After signing in, the user would be able to 
Set/View Profile,

Filter Products,

Add/Remove product to Cart,

Add/Remove product to Wishlist,

Checkout(payment),

View Order History,

Signout etc.

in no necessary order. We have employed the concept of localStorage extensively in our project for successful execution of all of the functionalities mentioned above.
